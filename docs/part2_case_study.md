# PART 2 â€” Case Study Application

## A. Problem Scope

**Problem Definition:** Predict patient readmission risk within 30 days to improve care and reduce costs.

**3 Objectives:**
- Reduce readmission rates by 15%.
- Identify high-risk patients for early intervention.
- Optimize resource allocation in hospitals.

**2 Stakeholders:**
- Healthcare providers: To deliver targeted care.
- Hospital administrators: To manage costs.

## B. Data Strategy

**Data Sources:** Electronic Health Records (EHRs), lab results, demographics, admission/discharge data.

**2 Ethical Concerns:**
- Privacy: Protecting patient data under HIPAA.
- Bias: Ensuring data represents diverse populations to avoid discriminatory predictions.

**Preprocessing Pipeline:**
- Data cleaning: Handle missing values, normalize features.
- Feature engineering: Create age groups, comorbidity scores.
- Encoding: Convert categorical variables to numerical.

## C. Model Development

**Model Choice:** Logistic Regression for interpretability in healthcare.

**Hypothetical Confusion Matrix:**
- TP: 150, FP: 50, TN: 200, FN: 100
- Precision: TP/(TP+FP) = 150/200 = 0.75
- Recall: TP/(TP+FN) = 150/250 = 0.6

## D. Deployment

**Integration Steps:**
- Develop API for model predictions.
- Integrate into EHR systems and dashboards.
- Train staff on using the system.

**Compliance:** Ensure HIPAA compliance by encrypting data, access controls, and regular audits to protect patient privacy and prevent breaches.

## E. Optimization

**Method to Address Overfitting:** Use cross-validation to validate model performance on unseen data.
