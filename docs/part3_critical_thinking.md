# PART 3 â€” Critical Thinking

## Ethics & Bias

**Impact of Biased Data:** Biased training data could lead to inaccurate predictions, disproportionately affecting minority groups, resulting in unequal healthcare access.

**Mitigation Strategy:** Use fairness-aware algorithms and diverse datasets.

## Trade-offs

**Interpretability vs Accuracy:** In healthcare, interpretability is crucial for trust and decision-making, even if accuracy is slightly lower.

**Compute Resources:** Limited resources favor simpler models like logistic regression over complex neural networks.
